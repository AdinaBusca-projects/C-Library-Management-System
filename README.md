In Library Managemet System each person can borrow multiple books from the library. Each person is uniquely identified by their name and surname.

Each book contains the following information: 
-title,
-author,
-copies available.

For each loan:
-which person borrowed the books,
-the books borrowed (title+author+borrowed copies).

Any person can see all the loans they made, search the library for a specific book and return or donate books.
